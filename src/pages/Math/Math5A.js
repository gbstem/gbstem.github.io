It teaches strategies for factoring polynomials, permutations and combinations, the Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion, and more. This class will be mostly problem-based. Instructors of this course possess deep experience in past math competitions. This course will be fast-paced, so be sure your child is ready for it before enrolling.";
